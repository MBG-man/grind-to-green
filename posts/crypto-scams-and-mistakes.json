      "text": "1. Phishing Scams These scams often arrive in your email or direct messages, pretending to be from trusted exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. They’ll prompt you to click a link and enter your login info. Always double-check URLs and never click suspicious links."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "2. Fake Giveaways On social media, scammers pose as celebrities or big crypto influencers promising to double your crypto if you send them a small amount first. The truth? You’ll never get that money back. If it sounds too good to be true, it is."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "3. Pump and Dump Groups These groups lure you in with promises of skyrocketing coins. They buy low, hype the coin, then dump it after newcomers (like you) invest. Always research a coin before investing and avoid hype-driven decisions."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "4. Fake Wallets or Exchanges Scammers sometimes build apps or websites that look just like real crypto wallets or exchanges. Once you transfer your funds, they’re gone. Only download wallets from trusted sources and double-check reviews and app developers."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "5. Sending Funds to the Wrong Address Unlike banks, crypto transfers are irreversible. Always copy-paste addresses carefully and double-check every character. A small mistake can cost you everything you sent."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "6. Investing Without Research (FOMO) Fear of missing out can lead you to invest blindly into tokens just because they’re trending. Always understand the project behind a coin—read its whitepaper, check the team, and assess long-term potential."
