Simply put: • 3 = Never risk more than **3%** of your total trading capital on a single trade. • 5 = Cap your **total exposure** (all open trades combined) to **5%** of your trading capital. • 7 = Ensure that your average winning trade is at least **7%** more profitable than your average losing trade (or target a 7:1 reward-to-loss ratio).  :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}"
