Whether you're living in Europe, Asia, Africa, North America, or the Middle East, ZBB helps you take full control of every dollar, euro, pound, naira, or yen you earn. Unlike traditional budgets that let expenses slip through the cracks, ZBB gives your money purpose. Every single unit of income is assigned to a category, and nothing is left unplanned."

Your money is allocated to needs, wants, savings, debt payments, investments, or any category you choose. Nothing sits idle. Nothing goes unaccounted for. This level of clarity makes it one of the most powerful budgeting systems worldwide."
